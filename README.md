# site_blocker
Google chrome extension that blocks websites and reminds you of your goals

This extension uses 2 lists which you can edit on the options page:

1. BLOCK list
- URLs added to this list will be blocked when in block mode. All other URLs will be allowed.

2. LIMIT list
- A whitelist. All URLs added to this list will be allowed when in limit mode. All other URLs will be blocked.

Toggle between block mode and limit mode from the popup. Add the URL of the current site you are on to either list from the popup.

Additionally, you can set some goals you want to be reminded of in the options page.
